# Eliza-
Chat bot

My name is Dave Clarke, I'm a third year studying Software Development in GMIT. I'm 22 years old and have lived in Galway 
all my life. I also currently work part time in the Meyrick Hotel in Galway city as a concierge.

I created this Chatbot called Eliza for a project in Data Representation. This project is worth 50% of the
overall mark of the course.

I found doing this project very tough when I began at first as I couldnt serve the webpage. Trying to connect 
my .go file to the HTML file. A group of 5 of us in the college decided to stay back after class nearly everyday
and meet up at the weekends if we could to help eachother out and get eachother out of stuck situations. Once I
got the file served, the next problem was taking in the user input and user output. After a few days I was back 
to continuing with the project and starting with the regular expression. I tried time and time again to use the
same code from my GoProblemSheet 3 but it just would not work, it kept skipping the if statements and going straight
to the random answers.
