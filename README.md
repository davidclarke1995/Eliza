# Eliza-
Chat bot

My name is Dave Clarke, I'm a third year studying Software Development in GMIT. I'm 22 years old and have lived in Galway 
all my life. I also currently work part time in the Meyrick Hotel in Galway city as a concierge.

To run this this project, clone my repository https://github.com/davidclarke1995/Eliza.git

I created this Chatbot called Eliza for a project in Data Representation. This project is worth 50% of the
overall mark of the course.

I found doing this project very tough when I began at first as I couldnt serve the webpage. Trying to connect 
my .go file to the HTML file. A group of 5 of us in the college decided to stay back after class nearly everyday
and meet up at the weekends if we could to help eachother out and get eachother out of stuck situations. Once I
got the file served, the next problem was taking in the user input and user output. After a few days I was back 
to continuing with the project and starting with the regular expression. I tried time and time again to use the
same code from my GoProblemSheet 3 but it just would not work, it kept skipping the if statements and going straight
to the random answers. So I managed to create arrays containing all the possible user inputs and another array with 
Elizas responses. I am able to use the regular expressions to take in a String input and output it with a sentence but 
for some reason it would not work every time I tried. I found a great way to split strings online using an equals
sign. When I eventually had it working, I just did lots of different phrases that the user may put in. I also used 


I came accross a few problems such as the script.js takes in a button to run Elizas responses but if the user selects
enter on their computer, it will refresh the page. I tried taking out the button and the then the function and messed
around with the code constantly but never managed to get it working. I had event.preventDefault(); in the javascript but
I still couldnt figure it out. I also had some problems with Eliza in the repository so I actually had 3 different Eliza 
projects.

Overall I found this project extremely difficult but proud that I have a functional working ChatBot
